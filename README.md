# EcoVolter Home Assistant Integration

A Home Assistant integration for EcoVolter EV chargers that enables you to control basic charging functions such as turning charging on and off, setting target current, and monitoring whether your vehicle is plugged in or actively charging. I originally created this integration for my own use, but thought others might find it helpful as well. Enjoy! :-)

## Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/ecovolter` folder to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add integration via Settings â†’ Devices & Services

## Features
